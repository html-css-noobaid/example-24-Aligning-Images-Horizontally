		    The barn owl (Tyto alba) is the most widely 
		    distributed species of owl and one of the most 
		    widespread of all birds. It is also referred to as the
		    common barn owl, to distinguish it from other species 
		    in its family, Tytonidae, which forms one of the two 
		    main lineages of living owls, the other being the 
		    typical owls (Strigidae). The barn owl is found almost 
		    everywhere in the world except polar and desert regions,
		    Asia north of the Himalayas, most of Indonesia, and
		    some Pacific islands.</p>

		    The American (North and South America) horned owls and
		    the Old World eagle-owls make up the genus Bubo, at least
		    as traditionally described. The genus name Bubo is Latin 
		    for the Eurasian eagle-owl. This genus, depending on 
                    definition, contains about one or two dozen species of 
		    typical owls (family Strigidae) and is found in many parts of the world.
		    Some of the largest living Strigiformes are in Bubo. Traditionally, only 
                    owls with ear-tufts were included in this genus, but that is no longer
                    the case.</p>
